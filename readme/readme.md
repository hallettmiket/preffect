# PREFFECT - PaRaffin Embedded Formalin-FixEd FixEd Cleaning Tool
Release Version 0.1

## Description
PREFFECT (PaRaffin Embedded Formalin-FixEd Cleaning Tool) is a probabilistic framework for the analysis of RNA sequencing data from formalin-fixed paraffin embedded (FFPE) samples. PREFFECT uses generative models to fit distributions to observed expression measurements while adjusting for technical and biological variables. PREFFECT offers a series of models that exploit multiple expression profiles generated from matched
tissues for a single sample, sample-sample adjacency networks and clinicopathological/technical sample variables.

PREFFECT is designed to accomplish the following tasks:
- Accurately denoise RNAseq data from FFPE materials (fRNAseq)
- Impute missing values from the count matrix
- Improve performance of standard analyses

# <u>User Guide</u>
PREFFECT allows the user to perform a series of tasks to clean, impute and evaluate RNA sequencing from FFPE materials. Below, we will describe how to set up your input, setup and optimize runs through the __config.py_ file, derive new models (training), retrain previously derived models (pre-train), as well as performing inference and other analyses.
