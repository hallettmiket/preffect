# PREFFECT - PaRaffin Embedded Formaldehye FixEd Cleaning Tool

## Imputation
Imputated count values from a PREFFECT model can be extracted in Python.

To load a pre-trained model into your Python session.
```python
    from preffect_factory import factory
    from _config import configs
    # Point to the PREFFECT model you wish to import
    configs['output_path'] = "/location/of/PREFFECT/Model" 
    preffect_object_reinstated = factory(task='reinstate', configs=configs, trigger_setup=True)
```

One can also train a PREFFECT model within the same Python session, if desired (see [Training a PREFFECT model](training.md)).

The imputed values of the models can then be extracted as an AnnData structure:
```python
inference_object = preffect_object_reinstated.inference_dict['endogenous']
adata_imputed = inference_object.impute_values()
```

This AnnData structure will consist of:
`adata_imputed.X` - The estimated count values for all genes and samples (the mean of the estimated NB/ZINB for each gene-sample pair)
`adata_imputed.layers["original_counts"]` - Count data used for training
`adata_imputed.layers["X_hat_theta"]` - The estimated dispersion of the estimated NB/ZINB for each gene-sample pair
`adata_imputed.layers["X_hat_pi"]` - The estimated dropout of the estimated ZINB for each gene-sample pair (will not exist if `model_likelihood` = "NB")
`adata_imputed.obs` - Batch and/or Subtype information, if provided.

## Evaluating Imputation of Artificially Zeroed Counts

PREFFEECT allows for the intentional masking of certain positions (replacing random counts with artificial zeroes) to simulate missing data during training to evaluate how well a model can impute those missing values. Similarly, PREFFECT allows for random masking of the sample-sample edge matrix (which assist graph attention mechanisms to identify the most informative correlations in the data). 

```python
masking_strategy' : "MCAR", # currently can be "MCAR" or None
'lambda_counts' : 0.1, # the maximum fraction of all entries of the expression matrix that are masked
'lambda_edges' : 0.0, # the maximum fraction of all entries of the sample-sample adjacency matrix that are masked
```

After training is complete, one can use the 'impute_experiment' task to evaluate the accuracy of both the masked positions, and an equal but random sampling of unmasked positions. These accuracy measures are provided as either mean relative error (`error_type="mre"`) or mean square error (`error_type="mse"`).
```python
inference_object, error_masked, error_unmasked  = factory(
    task='impute_experiment', 
    configs=configs, 
    preffect_obj=preffect_object, 
    inference_key = 'endogenous',
    error_type='mre'
)
```
